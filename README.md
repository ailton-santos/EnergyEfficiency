# Energy Efficiency
## Ailton Santos

This program reads the temperature, light, and current, calculates the energy efficiency, and displays the results on the Arduino's serial port. It waits one second before reading the sensors again. Note that the maximum power has been set to 1000 for example purposes and should be adjusted according to the specifications of the device to be monitored.
